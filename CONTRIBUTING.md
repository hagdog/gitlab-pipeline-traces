The `main` branch is the mainstream branch for all ROS nodes.

The `dev` branch is the primary testing and development branch, developed on directly by Kyle.

You should create feature branches from `dev`, with the form `{type}/{desc}/{ticket}`, and create MRs against `dev`. You can use `tt agent --ci-branch $branch` or other means to test your feature.
